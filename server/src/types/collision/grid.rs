/// Efficient spatial-index for collision checking.
///
/// This is a lookup structure to efficiently check
/// for circle-circle collisions without having `O(n^2)`
/// runtime in the average case. The way it works is
/// by putting circles into buckets, the number of
/// buckets is stored in `BUCKETS_X` and `BUCKETS_Y` in
/// the source file of this struct.
///
/// When checking a circle `x` for a collision, the
/// buckets are used as a preliminary filter to quickly
/// get a set of possible colliding circles. After that
/// they are checked linearly (`O(n)` for each circle).
///
/// # Caveats
/// - This can still be `O(n^2)` worst case if all the circles are in a single
///   bucket. (e.g. if there are multiple planes and missiles in the same
///   bucket.)
/// - Constructing the `Grid` is `O(n log n)` since the source array must be
///   sorted.
///
/// # Example
/// Creating a grid from a list of circles.
/// ```
/// # extern crate airmash_server;
/// # use airmash_server::types::collision::{Grid, HitCircle};
/// # fn main() {
/// # let circles_from_elsewhere = vec![];
/// // Hit circles from terrain, planes, etc.
/// let circles: Vec<HitCircle> = circles_from_elsewhere;
///
/// // Grid takes ownership of the hitcircle vector
/// let grid = Grid::new(circles);
/// # }
